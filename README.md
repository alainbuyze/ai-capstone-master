Run the command **python app.py**
Check if the app is runnin by opening **http://0.0.0.0:8080/** - you should seee the welcome page
#### Run the tests
In the directory **unittests**, execute the python module **ApiTests.py**
This will execute 4 test:
1. Test the train functionality
2. test fr appropriate faile in case of no data or ill-formed input
3. test the predict functionality
4. test the log functionality

## Are there unit tests for the model?

## Are there unit tests for the logging?

## Can all of the unit tests be run with a single script and do all of the unit tests pass?
 
## Is there a mechanism to monitor performance?


## Was there an attempt to isolate the read/write unit tests from production models and logs?


## Does the API work as expected? For example, can you get predictions for a specific country as well as for all countries combined?


## Does the data ingestion exists as a function or script to facilitate automation?


## Were multiple models compared?


## Did the EDA investigation use visualizations?


## Is everything containerized within a working Docker image?


## Did they use a visualization to compare their model to the baseline model?
